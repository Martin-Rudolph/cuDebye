# This folder contains some useful [_Matlab_](https://de.mathworks.com) scripts.

**The scripts need at least a 2014er version. All scripts were written with the version 2016a.**

These scripts can generate deb-files from much more comprehensive xyz-files, plot structures from a deb-file and view the
calculated diffraction patterns stored in a debI-file.

However, if you are looking for a open source variant you can try these scrips with 
[_GnuOctave_](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/), but there is no warranty, that these scripts run without problems.

Alternativley, you have to write your own scripts e.g. with [_Python_](https://python-xy.github.io/downloads.html) or
[_Gnuplot_](http://www.gnuplot.info/).
