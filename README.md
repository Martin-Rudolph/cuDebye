### AT THE MOMENT THIS FILE AND THE BRANCH ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION DO NOT USE THE PROGRAM UNTIL THIS LINE IS DELETED.

This is an open source software, you can use and redistribute everything, **but you are encouraged to cite our publicaction:**
- will be added soon

**As this is an experimental code the usage is at own risk**, we will not take on responsibility for a system crash or anything else.
_Do not use the program until you have read this documentation file completly._

## GENERAL INFORMATIONS

- the source code will be uploaded soon
- the source code was written and compiled for **Microsoft Windows x64** using _Microsoft Visual Studio 2015_ and the _NVidia Cuda Toolkit 8.0_
- programming language is _C++_ and _Cuda_
- at least a [_Cuda Compute Capability_](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#Unterst%C3%BCtzte_GPUs) of 2.1 or higher is recommended
- the program was tested only on the following graphic processing units (GPU): GTX 970, GTX 980TI and GTX 1080
- the program can use only one GPU and the workload will be around 100%
- **if the same GPU is used for display tasks, your screen will freeze during the calculation**
- thus, I use the _Intel's integrated HD graphics_ for my monitors, but you could also use a second dedicated GPU or wait until the calculation is done
